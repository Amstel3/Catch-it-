# Catch it!

A small 2D Unity game created as a portfolio project.

The game is built with a focus on clean structure and gameplay systems:
- Object pooling for fruits
- Simple MVC approach for score logic
- Game state management (Main Menu, Playing, Pause, Game Over)
- Input handling for both mouse and touch
- Gradually increasing difficulty over time

This project was created to practice Unity architecture, code organization, and gameplay feel rather than visual complexity.
