# Catch it!

Catch it! is a small 2D game made in Unity as a personal portfolio project.

The goal of the project was not to create a complex or content-heavy game, but to focus on clean architecture, readable code, and a solid gameplay foundation.

## Key features

- Object pooling system for falling fruits  
- Simple MVC structure for score handling  
- Centralized game state management  
  (Main Menu, Playing, Pause, Game Over)  
- Input support for both mouse and touch  
- Gradually increasing difficulty over time  

## About the project

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Unity architecture, code organization, and gameplay feel.  
It represents a completed, polished iteration rather than an experimental prototype.

The focus was on writing understandable, maintainable code and building systems that can be easily extended in the future.
